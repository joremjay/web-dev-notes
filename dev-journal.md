## Template for each day

## 2025-11-11
**Focus:** HTML structure + basic CSS layout

- What I did:
  - Created `01-landing-page` project with `index.html` and `style.css`.
  - Built a simple semantic layout (header, hero, services, about, contact, footer).
  - Added Flexbox header and responsive grid for services.
- What I learned:
  - How to link an external CSS file.
  - How to use semantic tags instead of random `<div>`s.
  - How a simple media query can change layout on mobile.
- Confusions:
  - (Example) Not fully confident when to use Grid vs Flexbox.
